WPPO plugin TODO
================

- Integrate with Damned Lies

    WPPO translation plugin doesn't work alone. Damned lies must be configured
    to both get the POT file and send translated PO files to the server.

- Create a link to run the existing function that parses the translated PO files

    Right now we have the function that parses the PO files, but there is no
    configured way to execute it.
    
    If Damned lies supports it, we can configure it to run a specific URL and
    run this function. Otherwise we should create an admin area with the
    link to the page that does that.

- Search mechanism in WordPress doesn't search for translated pages

    We must tweak search engine in WordPress to search translated content when
    viewing the website in another language.
    
    Right now the translated content is viewed in the search results, but the 
    query can only be in english.
    
- Fix XML2PO xhtml mode

    Currently xhtml mode[1] from xml2po don't care about ignoring "src" and "href"
    params to the translator. We need to fix this if we don't want translators
    to change URLs.

- Custom menus aren't translatable
    
    Custom links in menus aren't translatable. These items are stored in the
    wp_posts table under "nav_menu_item" post_type, which are skiped by the
    WPPO function that selects what content will have translations.
    
    After allowing those items to be translated, a filter needs to be created 
    somehow to apply the translation to these custom links.
    
- Store all the available languages

    Currently WPPO stores the translated content, but there is no fast way to 
    discover what are the available languages, and how much is the PO file 
    of each language translated.
    
    WPPO should have an admin are with these stats.


- Pages don't have absolute address

    @MINOR

    This is not a major issue for the user, but it is for search robots[2].
    Each page should have an absolute path, like http://gnome.org/es/acerca/
    instead of http://gnome.org/about/?lang=es
    
    Also, we should update translated content to point the links to translated
    pages.
